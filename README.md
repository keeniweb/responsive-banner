# responsive-banner
Just a responsive banner that I would love to get some feedback on!

This banner is in part a piece that I acquired through another open source project that I thought would be helpful to anyone just starting out with responsive web design. It's been tested on Safari, Chrome, and IE9, so any comments or fixes for other browsers that might have a bug would be helpful.

The code itself is fairly simple, but I identify as a newbie so if you have a ton of experience, I'd love to hear from you!
